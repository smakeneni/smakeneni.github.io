## PORTFOLIO 
{: .text-center}
These are projects that I have done over the last year which are representative of my skills and interests. I have divided them into three categories as seen below. For each individual project, I have included a brief summary, detailed report, and  link to the code. If you have further questions, please feel leave a comment or contact me

{% include feature_row id="feature_row1" type="center" %}
{% include feature_row id="feature_row2" type="center" %}
{% include feature_row id="feature_row3" type="center" %}
{% include feature_row id="feature_row4" type="center" %}
