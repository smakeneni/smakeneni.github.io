    text: "In this project, I have first developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch in Jupyter Notebook, then converted it into a command line application. The application allows you to choose one of the pretrained architectures, specify different hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden layers, epochs) and use either GPU or CPU for training. I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "

Each week, I take part in a social project called #TidyTuesday challenge hosted by the R for data science community. They post a raw data set and allow the participants to explore the data and summarize it into meaningful data visualizations. This challenge provides an opportunity to practice data wrangling and visualizations skills as well as to connect with the #rstats community. Most of the visualiations you will see below were done as a part of this challenge.

**Skills used for these visualizations:  R shiny, ggplot2, plotly, tidyverse**
