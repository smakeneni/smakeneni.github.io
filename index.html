Through my formal training in bioinformatics and computational chemistry, I obtained extensive experience processing large scientific
datasets and programming. I have recently extended my skills to include machine learning algorithms and advanced statistical modeling.
I am excited to bring together my scientific background and a passion for data analysis with the rapidly evolving data science toolsets to 
tackle challenges that impact business decisions.
